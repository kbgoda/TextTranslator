EUTHYPHRO



From Plato




Translated by Benjamin Jowett








INTRODUCTION.


In Meno, Anytus was separated from Socrates by the important words:
&quot;That in any city, and especially in the city of Athens, it is easier
to harm men rather than to do them good; and Socrates waited
another opportunity to talk to him. In Euthyphro, Socrates is
awaiting trial for impunity. But before the trial begins, Plato
they want to put the world on trial and convince them of ignorance
this is very important that Socrates is accused. An incident that
may have occurred in the Euthyphro family, a
learned Athenian diviner and seer, provides his opportunity
discussion.


This Euthyphro and Socrates are represented as meeting on his veranda
the King of Principles. (Comparing Theaet.) Both have legal business activity.
Socrates is accused of impunity brought by Meletos
against him (noted by the way he is not a possible man
he himself had brought an action against another). and Euthyphro is also
plaintiffs in a lawsuit for murder, which he filed against him
his own father. The latter was created as follows: - A poor man
dependent on the family had killed one of their domestic slaves in Naxos.
The culprit was committed and thrown into a ditch on his orders
The father of Efthyfros, who sent to the interpreters of religion in Athens
to ask what needs to be done with it. Before the messenger returned it
criminal had died of starvation and exposure.


This is the origin of the murder charge brought by Euthyphro
against his father. Socrates is convinced that he could have done it before
took responsibility for such a persecution, it must have been
fully aware of the nature of piety and impunity. and as it is
he is going to be tested for impunity, he thinks he can&#39;t
better than learning about Euthyphro (which will be accepted by all,
including judges, to be an unacceptable principle) what is piety,
and what is impunity. So what is piety?


Euthyphro, who, with his abundance of knowledge, is very willing to do so
I take full responsibility, answers: This piety does as I do,
prosecution of your father (if guilty) on the charge of murder;
as the gods do - as Zeus did in Saturn and Saturn in Heaven.


Socrates dislikes these mythological stories and wants it
This dissatisfaction may be the reason he is being punished for impunity.
&quot;Is true;&quot; &#39;Yes it is;&#39; and Euthyphro will say with joy
Socrates some of them. But Socrates would first like to have
a more satisfactory answer to the question, &quot;What is piety?&quot; &quot;It simply came to our notice then
I, blaming a father for murder, &quot;can be a unique example of piety,
but can hardly be considered a general definition.


Euthyphro replies that &quot;piety is what is dear to the gods and impunity
it&#39;s what they don&#39;t like. &quot;It simply came to our notice then
opinion, as among men, so among the gods? Especially for good
and evil, which do not have a fixed rule. and that&#39;s exactly the kind
disputes that cause controversy. And so what can be dear
to one god he may not be dear to another, and the same action may be both
pious and ungodly; e.g. your father&#39;s punishment, Euthyphro, may
to be dear or pleasant to Zeus (who imposed a similar punishment on him
his own father), but not as pleasant for Saturn or Uranus (who suffered
in the hands of their sons).


Euthyphro replies that there is no difference of opinion
gods or men, as to the appropriateness of punishing a murderer. Yes, it comes back
Socrates, when they know him to be a murderer. but you guessed it
controversial point. If all the circumstances of the case are taken into account, it is
you can show that your father was guilty of murder or that all this
do the gods agree to approve our persecution for him? And you should
not allow what one god hates to please another? Resignation
The latter, however, Socrates proposes amending the definition and
say that “what all the gods love is pious and what everyone hates is
irreverent.&#39; Euthyphro agrees.


Socrates proceeds to analyze the new form of definition. Shows
that in other cases the act precedes the state; the act of existence
transported, loved, etc. precede the state of metaphor, love, etc.
and therefore what is dear to the gods is dear to the gods why
First we love them, not the loved ones because they like them.
But the pious or the saints are loved by the gods because they are pious or holy,
which is equivalent to saying that they really like it because it is
their beloved. So here is a contradiction - Euthyphro has
giving a characteristic or accident of piety only, and not substance.
Euthyphro acknowledges that his explanations seem to be moving forward
away or turn in a circle, like the moving figures of Daedalus, the
ancestor of Socrates, who has passed on his art to his descendants.


Socrates, who wants to stimulate his awful intelligence
Euthyphro asks the question in a different way: &quot;Everyone is pious
just?&#39; &#39;Yes.&#39; &quot;Is he just pious?&quot; &#39;No.&#39; &quot;It simply came to our notice then
is piety? &quot;Euthyphro answers that piety is that part of justice that
&quot;Attends&quot; to the gods, as there is another part of justice that
&quot;Attends&quot; men. But what is the meaning of &quot;coming&quot; to the gods?
The word &quot;monitoring&quot; when applied to dogs, horses and men, implies
that somehow they get better. But how do they do pious or sacred deeds?
do the gods do better? Euthyphro explains that he means in pious ways
acts, acts of service or administration. Yes; but his orders
the husband, the doctor and the builder have an end. For what purpose do you do
do we serve the gods and what do we help them achieve? Cheerful
answers that all these difficult questions cannot be solved in a
short time; and he would rather just say that piety knows how to do it
I pray to the gods with words and deeds, with prayers and sacrifices. To another
Socrates says words, piety is &quot;a science of demand and supply&quot; - question
what do we want and giving what they want? in short, a way of execution
business between gods and humans. But even though they are everyone&#39;s donors
good, how can we give them some good in return? &quot;It simply came to our notice then
price.&#39; Then we do not give them what is beneficial, but what is pleasant
or their beloved? and this is the point that has already been proven.


Socrates, although tired of the recurrences and escapes of Efthyfros,
remains unchanged in his belief that he must know his nature
piety, or he would never have persecuted his father. It&#39;s still
hoping he would back down to teach him. But Euthyphro is in one
hurry up and I can&#39;t stay. And Socrates&#39; last hope is to know nature
of piety before being prosecuted for impunity has disappeared. Like
The Irony the irony continues until the end.


Euthyphro is obviously designed to compare its true nature
piety and disrespect with their popular perceptions. But when the
their popular perceptions have been overturned, Socrates does not
to offer any of its own definitions: as in Laches and Lysis, it is prepared
the way to answer the question he asked; but true
his character refuses to answer himself.


Euthyphro is religious and is mentioned elsewhere, if any
same person as the author of a philosophy of names, from which he &quot;progresses&quot;
Socrates of the buildings in Kratylos is seduced. He has the pride and
a sophist&#39;s confidence. no doubt he is right in the prosecution
his father never entered his mind. Like a sophist, he is
unable to either formulate a general definition or follow it
course of an argument. Wrong headache, unilateral, tightness,
positive, is characteristic of the priestly office. His failure
to capture an argument can be compared to a similar flaw that
is noticeable in Ion Rhapsody. But he&#39;s not bad, and he is
friendly to Socrates, whose well-known mark he recognizes with interest.
Although unable to follow him, he is very willing to lead him, and
every suggestion that saves him from the problem is impatiently raised
of thought. In addition, he is the enemy of the Study, which, as he says, is
taking advantage of the popular dislike for religious innovation
to hurt Socrates; at the same time it is fun to be confident
that he has weapons in his arsenal that would be more than just a match
for him. She is quite honest in prosecuting his father, who has
he was accidentally guilty of manslaughter and is not completely exempt from liability.
The clearance of the crime appears to him in the light of a duty, whoever
may be the criminal.


This is how the opposition between the religion of the letter or its begins
narrow and unenlightened consciousness, and the higher meaning of religion
which Socrates tries in vain to extract from him. &quot;It simply came to our notice then
as I do ”is the idea of religion that first appears to him, and to many
others who do not say what they believe with equal honesty. For men it is
they were not easily persuaded that any other religion was better than their own.
or that other nations, e.g. the Greeks in the time of Socrates, were
just as serious in their religious beliefs and difficulties. THE CHIEF
The difference between us and them is that they learn slowly what
we are in the process of forgetting. Greek mythology could hardly admit it
distinction between accidental homicide and murder: that pollution
of the blood was the same in both cases is the feeling of the Athenian
fortune teller. He had not yet learned the lesson, what the philosophy was
teaching that Homer and Hesiod, if not expelled from the state, or
removed from the assembly, as Heraclitus suggested more rude to anyone
the percentage should not be infringed as religious principles; and it is
ready to defend his behavior with the examples of the gods. These are the
many stories that Socrates cannot keep. and his opposition to them, as he
Suspects have identified him with the reputation of impunity. Here is one
Answer to the question &quot;Why was Socrates murdered&quot;, suggests
the way. Another expresses himself with the words, “Athenians do not care
for every man who thinks wisely until he begins to make other men wise.
and then for some reason or another they are angry: “something that can be said
to be the rule of popular tolerance in most other countries, and not in
Only for Athens. During the argument, Socrates observes that the
The controversial nature of morals and religion stems from the difficulty
of their verification. There is no measure or standard in which they can be
refers.


The next definition, &quot;Worship is what is worshiped by the gods,&quot; is
crashed into a subtle distinction between state and deed,
corresponds respectively to the adjective (philon) and to the participle
(kissing), or rather perhaps to the participant and to the verb
(kissed and filleted) The act is before the state (as in
Aristotle&#39;s energy precedes dunamis). and the state of existence
preceded by the act of love. But piety or holiness is
preceded by the act of piety, not the act of love. and
So piety and the state of love are different. Through such
subtlety of dialectical Socrates works in a deeper area
of thought and emotion. It means saying the words “he loved it
the gods express a characteristic only and not the essence of piety.


He then follows the third and final definition, “Worship is part of it
justice.&#39; So far, Socrates has embraced religion
moral foundation. It seeks to realize the harmony of religion and
ethics, which the great poets Aeschylus, Sophocles and Pindar had
unconsciously expected, and that is the universal need of all men.
To this the magician adds the ritual element, “watching it
gods. &quot;When he was further questioned by Socrates about his nature
this &quot;attention to the gods&quot; answers that piety is a matter
business, a science of giving and asking and the like. Socrates grades
from the anthropomorphism of these perceptions, (compare Symp.? Republic;
Politicus.) But when we wait for it to continue and show that it is true
the service of the gods is the service of spirit and cooperation
with them in all things true and good, it stops soon. that was a lesson
which the fortune teller could not understand and who
everyone has to learn about themselves.


There seem to be a total of three goals or interests in this little one
Dialogue: (1) the dialectical development of the idea of piety. (2) the
contrast of true and false religion, which is transferred to a certain
only area; (3) the defense of Socrates.


The subtle connection with Apology and Judgment. restraint
of the conclusion, as in Charmides, Lysis, Laches, Protagoras, and
other dialogues; the deep picture of the religious world. the dramatic
strength and play of the two characters; unparalleled irony is reason
because I think Euthyphro is a genuine Platonic writing. The
spirit in which the popular representations of mythology are denounced
reminds Republic II. The virtue of piety has already been mentioned
as one of the five in Protagoras, but is not considered among the four
basic virtues of the Republic IV. The figure of Daedalus appeared in
the Meno? that of the Proteus in Euthydius and Io. The royal science
has already appeared in Euthydemus and will reappear in
Democracy and politics. But neither from these nor from other indications
similarity or difference, and even less than respectable arguments
the appropriateness of this little job to help Socrates in his day
trial or vice versa, evidence may be obtained for the date.








EUTHYPHRO





PERSON OF THE DIALOGUE: Socrates, Efthyfros.


SCENE: The veranda of King Archon.




EUTHYPHRO: Why did you leave high school, Socrates? and what are you?
to do on the veranda of King Archon? You certainly can&#39;t worry
a suit in front of the King, like me?


SOCRATES: Not in a suit, Euthyphro? Guilt is the word that
The Athenians use.


EUTHYPHRO: What! I guess someone is chasing you, for me
I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re someone else&#39;s prosecutor.


SOCRATES: Certainly not.


EUTHYPHRO: Then someone else is chasing you?


SOCRATES: Yes.


EUTHYPHRO: And who is it?


SOCRATES: A young man who is little known, Euthyphro and I hardly know
him: his name is Meletus, and he is from the deme of Pitthis. Maybe you
he may remember his appearance. has beak, and long straight hair, and
a beard that is sick.


EUTHYPHRO: No, I don&#39;t remember him, Socrates. But what is the charge?
who brings against you?


SOCRATES: What is the charge? Well, a very serious category, which shows
a good character to the young man, and for whom he is for sure
do not despise. He says he knows how young people are corrupt and
who are their corrupt people. I imagine he has to be wise, and see
that I am the opposite of a wise man, he has found me and is going
to accuse me of corrupting his new friends. And from this our mother the
state must be the judge. Of all our politicians, he is the only one
which seems to me to start in the right way, with its cultivation
virtue in youth like a good husband, makes new shoots
first care and cleanses us of what is destructive. This is
only the first step; He will then attend the older branches.
and if it continues as it has started, it will be a very large audience
benefactor.


EUTHYPHRO: I hope it can. but I&#39;m rather afraid, Socrates, that
The opposite will be true. My opinion is that during the attack
you are simply aiming for a blow to the foundations of the state. But in
how does it say you are reaching out to young people?


SOCRATES: He brings a wonderful accusation against me, which in the beginning
hearing is surprising: it says that I am a poet or a creator of gods, and
that I invent new gods and deny the existence of old ones. this is the
due to his indictment.


EUTHYPHRO: I understand, Socrates. means to attack you for it
known sign that occasionally, as you say, comes to you. Thinks
that you are a neologist and that he will make you before
court for that. He knows that such a charge is easily taken by him
people like me I know very well. because when I talk to the assembly about
divine things, and prophesy the future in them, make me laugh and
I think I&#39;m crazy. However, every word I say is true. But it is
we are all jealous. and we must be brave and follow them.


SOCRATES: Their laughter, friend Euthyphro, is not a big deal
consistency. Because a man can be wise. but the Athenians, me
suspect, don&#39;t bother too much about him until he starts
transmit his wisdom to others, and then for some reason or another, perhaps,
as you say, out of jealousy, they are angry.


EUTHYPHRO: I&#39;m never going to test their composure this way.


SOCRATES: I dare not say, because you are wary of your behavior and
you rarely transmit your wisdom. But I have a good habit of overflowing
myself to everyone, and I will pay even for a listener, and I am afraid
that Athenians can believe me very talkative. Now if, as I said,
they would only laugh at me, as you say they laugh at you, the
time can pass quite happily in court. but it may be
honestly, and then what will be the end that only you can predict.


EUTHYPHRO: I dare say that the case will not end in anything, Socrates and
that you will win your purpose. and I think I will win mine.


SOCRATES: And what is your suit, Euthyphro? you are the pursuer or the
defendant?


EUTHYPHRO: I&#39;m the hunter.


SOCRATES: From whom?


EUTHYPHRO: You will consider me crazy when I tell you.


SOCRATES: Why does he have fugitives?


EUTHYPHRO: No, he is not very unstable at the moment of his life.


SOCRATES: Who is it?


EUTHYPHRO: My father.


SOCRATES: Your father! my good man?


EUTHYPHRO: Yes.


SOCRATES: And what is he accused of?


EUTHYPHRO: For murder, Socrates.


SOCRATES: From the forces, Euthyphro! how little the common herd knows
the nature of the right and the truth. A man must be a great man,
and they have made great strides in wisdom before he could see his way
to bring such energy.


EUTHYPHRO: Indeed, Socrates must.


SOCRATES: I guess he was one of those who killed your father
your relatives - clearly they were; because if he were a stranger you would do it
I never thought of prosecuting him.


EUTHYPHRO: I&#39;m having fun, Socrates, when you differentiate between
the one who is a relationship and the one who is not a relationship. for sure
Pollution is the same in both cases if you knowingly connect
the killer when you have to clean yourself and him by moving on
against him. The real question is whether the killer was
fairly killed. If fair, then it is your job to discover what that is and to bring it about. but
if it is unfair, then even if the killer lives under the same roof as
you and eat at the same table, go against him. Now the man he is
The dead man was a poor man dependent on mine who worked for us as a laborer.
at our farm in Naxos, and one day matches a drunken passion
in a dispute with one of our domestic servants and killed him. My father
he tied his hand and foot and threw him into a ditch, and then he was sent to
Athens to ask an oracle what to do with it. Meanwhile he
He never gave it to him and did not take care of him, because he considered him as
a killer? and I thought it wouldn&#39;t hurt much even if he did
mold. That&#39;s exactly what happened. That&#39;s why it was the result of the cold
and hunger and chains on him, which before the return of the messenger
the oracle, he was dead. Both my father and family are angry with me
taking the side of the murderer and persecuting my father. They say
that he did not kill him, and that if he did, the dead were only one
killer, and I shouldn&#39;t be careful, because the son is disrespectful
who is chasing a father. This shows, Socrates, how little they know
what the gods believe about piety and impunity.


SOCRATES: Nice skies, Euthyphro! and it is your knowledge of religion
and things pious and disrespectful so much, that we assume that
circumstances may be as you state them, do not be afraid
can he commit an inappropriate act against your father?


EUTHYPHRO: The best of Euthyphro, and what sets it apart,
Socrates, from other men, is his exact knowledge of all these matters.
What should I be good at without it?


SOCRATES: Rare friend! I don&#39;t think I can do better than be yours
pupil. Then, before the trial with Meletus, I will challenge
and tell him that I have always been very interested in religion
questions, and now, as it charges me with fantasy rashes and
innovations in religion, I have become your student. You, Meletus, as
I will tell him, acknowledge Euthyphro that he is a great theologian, and
sound in his views; and if you approve it you have to approve it
me and I don&#39;t have me in court. but if you reject it, you have to start over
blaming him who is my teacher, and who will be the disaster, not his
young, but from the old; that is, for myself giving orders,
and his old father, whom he warns and punishes. And if the Study
he refuses to listen to me, but he will continue, and he will not change
accusation from me to you, I can&#39;t do better than repeat this challenge
in the court.


EUTHYPHRO: Yes, indeed, Socrates. and if he tries to accuse me, I am
wrong if I don&#39;t find a flaw in him? the court will have a big one
I share more to tell him than I do.


SOCRATES: And I, my dear friend, know this, I want to be
your student. Because I notice that no one seems to notice you - not even
this Meletus; but his sharp eyes have found me immediately, and he has it
He forbade me to be disrespectful. And so please tell me
nature of piety and impunity, which you said I knew so well, and
murder and other crimes against the gods. What is? Is
Isn&#39;t piety always the same in every action? and disrespect, again - it is not
always the opposite of piety, and also the same with himself, having, as
impunity, a concept that includes what is disrespectful?


EUTHYPHRO: Of course, Socrates.


SOCRATES: And what is piety and what is impunity?


EUTHYPHRO: piety does as I do. that is, by expelling anyone
someone who is guilty of murder, sacrilege or similar crime - either
this is your father or mother, or whoever he is - he doesn&#39;t
difference; and not persecuting them is impunity. And please
Think, Socrates, what a remarkable proof I will give you of the truth
of my words, a proof that I have already given to others: - of
principle, I mean, the ungodly, whoever he is, must not go
unpunished. Because men do not consider Zeus to be the best and fairest
the gods; - and yet they admit that he binds his father (Saturn) because
he badly ruined his sons, and that he had punished his own
father (Uranus) for a similar reason, anonymously. And yet when
I go against my father, they are angry with me. They are so inconsistent
in their own way to speak when the gods are interested and when I am
interested.


SOCRATES: That may not be the reason, Euthyphro, for whom I am accused
disrespect - that I can&#39;t escape these stories about the gods? and
so I guess people think I&#39;m wrong. But, as you are well
informed about approving them, I can&#39;t do better than he agrees
your superior wisdom. What else can I say, confessing like me, that
I don&#39;t know anything about them? Tell me, about the love of Zeus, or you
I really think it&#39;s true.


EUTHYPHRO: Yes, Socrates? and things even more wonderful, of which
the world is in ignorance.


SOCRATES: And you really believe that the gods fought with one
another, and had terrible quarrels, battles and the like, as poets
say, and as you can see they are represented in the works of great artists?
The temples are full of them. and especially Athena&#39;s robe, which is
It is transferred to the Acropolis of the great Panathinaikos, it is embroidered
with them. Are all these stories of the gods true, Euthyphro?


EUTHYPHRO: Yes, Socrates? and, as I said, I can tell you, if you
I would like to hear them, many other things about the gods that will
surprises you.


SOCRATES: I dare say. and you will tell me another time when
I have free time. But right now I would rather hear from you a
more accurate answer, which you have not yet given, my friend, to
question, what is &quot;reverence&quot;? When you asked, you only answered, Do as you please
you do, accusing your father of murder.


EUTHYPHRO: And what I said was true, Socrates.


SOCRATES: Without a doubt, Euthyphro? but you will admit that there are many
other pious deeds?


EUTHYPHRO: There are.


SOCRATES: Remember that I did not ask you to give me two or three
examples of piety, but to explain the general idea that makes everyone pious
things that need to be pious. You don&#39;t remember an idea that
did he make the careless ungodly and the pious pious?


EUTHYPHRO: I remember.


SOCRATES: Tell me what the nature of this idea is and then I will do it
I have a template on which I can look and with which I can measure actions,
either yours or yours, and then I can say
that such and such an act is pious, another ungodly.


EUTHYPHRO: I&#39;ll tell you if you want.


SOCRATES: I would love to.


EUTHYPHRO: So piety is what is dear to the gods and impunity
it&#39;s what they don&#39;t like.


SOCRATES: Very good, Euthyphro? you have now given me the answer
that I wanted. But whether what you say is true or not, I still can&#39;t
say, though I have no doubt that you will prove the truth of yours
words.


EUTHYPHRO: Of course.


SOCRATES: So come and let&#39;s look at what we say. This thing
or a person who is dear to the gods is pious, and this thing or person
who is hated by the gods is disrespectful, these two are the extreme
the opposites between them. Wasn&#39;t that said?


EUTHYPHRO: It was.


SOCRATES: And he said well?


EUTHYPHRO: Yes, Socrates, I thought. it was definitely said.


SOCRATES: And moreover, Euthyphro, the gods admitted to having
hostilities and hatred and differences?


EUTHYPHRO: Yes, it was said.


SOCRATES: And what kind of difference creates enmity and anger? I assume
for example that you and I, my good friend, disagree on a number. I am doing
Differences of this kind make us enemies and differentiate us from one another
another? We don&#39;t immediately go into arithmetic, and end them with one
sum?


EUTHYPHRO: True.


SOCRATES: Or suppose we differ in size, not fast
end differences by counting?


EUTHYPHRO: Very true.


SOCRATES: And we end a dispute for heavy and light by resorting
weighing machine?


EUTHYPHRO: To be sure.


SOCRATES: But what differences are there that cannot be decided that way?
and therefore that they make us angry and make us hostile to each other?
I dare say that the answer does not appear to you at this time, and therefore
I would suggest that these hostilities arise when the issues of difference
they are righteous and unrighteous, good and bad, honest and dishonest.
These are not the points that men differ from and for when we
we cannot decide our differences satisfactorily, you and I and everyone
do we disagree when we argue? (Comparison of Alcib.)


EUTHYPHRO: Yes, Socrates, the nature of the differences for which we
the controversy is as you describe.


SOCRATES: And the quarrels of the gods, noble Efthifros, when they
do they happen, are they of a similar nature?


EUTHYPHRO: It definitely is.


SOCRATES: There are different views, as you say, about the good and the bad
bad, fair and unjust, honest and dishonest: there would be
there were no disputes between them, if there were none
differences - would there be now?


EUTHYPHRO: You&#39;re right.


SOCRATES: Not every man loves what he considers noble and just
good, and you hate the opposite of them?


EUTHYPHRO: Very true.


SOCRATES: But, as you say, people think the same things, some as simple
and others as unjust, - they disagree. and so wars arise
and battles with each other.


EUTHYPHRO: Very true.


SOCRATES: Then the gods hate the same things and love them
gods, and are they so hated and loved by them?


EUTHYPHRO: True.


SOCRATES: And with that in mind, the same things, Euthyphro, will be pious
and also disrespectful?


EUTHYPHRO: So I have to assume


SOCRATES: Then, my friend, I notice with surprise that you have not done so
answered the question I asked. Because I certainly didn&#39;t ask you
to tell me what action is pious and ungodly: but now it seems
that what the gods love is also hated by them. Therefore,
Euthyphro, thus punishing your father, is likely to do
what is pleasing to Jupiter, but unpleasant to Saturn or Uranus, and what
is acceptable to Hephaestus but unacceptable from here, and may exist
other gods who have similar views.


EUTHYPHRO: But I believe, Socrates, that all the gods would agree as
in the proper punishment of a murderer: there would be no difference
opinion on this.


SOCRATES: Well, but talking about men, Euthyphro, you&#39;ve never heard
one argues that a murderer or any kind of evil agent must leave
away from?


EUTHYPHRO: I would rather say that these are the questions they ask
they always support, especially in the courts: they commit all kinds of things
crimes, and there is nothing they will not do or say on their own
his own defense.


SOCRATES: But they admit their guilt, Euthyphro, but they say that
should not be punished?


EUTHYPHRO: No? They do not.


SOCRATES: Then there are some things they don&#39;t dare to say
and do: because they are not trying to claim to be guilty
unpunished, but they deny their guilt, don&#39;t they?


EUTHYPHRO: Yes.


SOCRATES: Then they do not claim that the criminal should not be
they are punished, but they support who is cunning and
what did he do and when?


EUTHYPHRO: True.


SOCRATES: And the gods are in the same case, if you claim them
controversy over justice and injustice, and some of them say while others deny it
that injustice is done to each other. Because neither God nor man will do it
do you ever try to say that the wrongdoer should not be punished?


EUTHYPHRO: That&#39;s true, Socrates, mainly.


SOCRATES: But they are involved in matters concerning the elements - gods and men.
and, if they dispute at all, they disagree on an act called
in that case, and which is confirmed by some to be fair, by others to be
unfair. It&#39;s not true;


EUTHYPHRO: Very true.


SOCRATES: Well, my dear friend Euthyphro, tell me, for my better
instructions and information, what proof do you have that in your opinion
all gods a servant who is guilty of murder, and enters chains from
the master of the dead, and dies because chains have been placed in the past
He who binds him can learn from the interpreters of the gods what
he has to do with it, he dies unjustly; and that on behalf of such
a son must go against his father and accuse him of murder. How
you would show that all gods totally agree with his approval
pretend? Prove to me that they do, and I will applaud your wisdom for as long as possible
Live.


EUTHYPHRO: It will be a difficult task. but I could do a lot
purely for you.


SOCRATES: I understand. you mean I&#39;m not that fast
fear as judges: for them you will be sure to prove it
the act is unjust and hatred of the gods.


EUTHYPHRO: Yes, Socrates. at least if they listen to me.


SOCRATES: But they will be sure that they will listen if they find out that you are
good speaker. There was an idea that came to my mind while you were there
Speaking; I said to myself, &quot;Well, even if Euthyphro proves it
I that all the gods considered the death of the slave unjust, how can I
do you know anything more than the nature of piety and impunity? to grant it
This action may be hatred for the gods, yet piety and impunity are not
sufficiently defined by these distinctions, for what is hated
to the gods it has been proved that it is also pleasant and dear to them. &quot; And
So, Euthyphro, I&#39;m not asking you to prove it. I&#39;ll guess, if
you like that all the gods condemn and despise such an action. But I
it will modify the definition to the extent that it will say what all the gods hate
they are ungodly and what they love pious or holy and what some of them
love and others hatred are both or both. That is our definition
piety and impunity?


EUTHYPHRO: Why not, Socrates?


SOCRATES: Why not! definitely, for me, Euthyphro, there
there is no reason why not. But if this introduction will help you a lot
in the task of guiding me as you promised, it is a matter for you to do
think.


EUTHYPHRO: Yes, I must say that what all the gods love is pious and
sacred, and the opposite that everyone hates, disrespectful.


SOCRATES: We must investigate the truth of this, Euthyphro, or
just to accept the simple statement of our own power and that of it
others? What do you think?


EUTHYPHRO: We have to ask and I believe the statement will
withstand the test of research.


SOCRATES: We will know better, my good friend, in a little while. The
The point I would like to make first is whether the pious or
holy is loved by the gods because it is sacred, or sacred because it is
beloved of the gods.


EUTHYPHRO: I don&#39;t understand what you mean, Socrates.


SOCRATES: I will try to explain: we, we are talking about transportation and we
we are talking about metaphor, guidance and guidance, sight and sight.
You know that in all these cases there is a difference, and you know it
what is the difference?


EUTHYPHRO: I think I understand.


SOCRATES: And it is not what is dear that is separate from what is
loves;


EUTHYPHRO: Definitely.


SOCRATES: Well. and now tell me, it&#39;s what&#39;s going on in this situation
of transport because it is transported or for some other reason?


EUTHYPHRO: No? This is the reason.


SOCRATES: And the same goes for what is driven and what it looks like?


EUTHYPHRO: True.


SOCRATES: And one thing does not seem to be visible, but on the contrary,
visible why it seems? nor is anything driven because it is in
guidance or movement because it is in the state of existence
was transferred, but vice versa. And now I think, Euthyphro, that
my meaning will be understood. and my point is, that every situation
action or passion implies previous action or passion. It can not be done
why it is done, but it is able to be done why
is it done? nor does he suffer because he is in distress,
but he is in pain because he is suffering. You do not agree;


EUTHYPHRO: Yes.


SOCRATES: It is not what is worshiped in a situation, whether it is done or not
suffering?


EUTHYPHRO: Yes.


SOCRATES: The same is true in previous cases. her condition
To love follows the act of love and not the act of the state.


EUTHYPHRO: Definitely.


SOCRATES: And what do you say about piety, Euthyphro: it&#39;s not piety,
by your definition, beloved by all gods?


EUTHYPHRO: Yes.


SOCRATES: Because he is pious or holy, or for some other reason?


EUTHYPHRO: No, that&#39;s the reason.


SOCRATES: Is he loved because he is holy, not holy because he is loved?


EUTHYPHRO: Yes.


SOCRATES: And what is dear to the gods is loved by them, and is within
a state that will love them because they like them?


EUTHYPHRO: Definitely.


SOCRATES: Then what is dear to the gods, Euthyphro, is not sacred,
Not even what is God&#39;s beloved, as you confirm. but they are two
different things.


EUTHYPHRO: What do you mean, Socrates?


SOCRATES: I want to say that the saint has been recognized by us
He was loved by God because he is holy, not to be holy because he is loved.


EUTHYPHRO: Yes.


SOCRATES: But what is dear to the gods is dear to them because
he is loved by them, he does not love them because he is dear to them.


EUTHYPHRO: True.


SOCRATES: But, friend Euthyphro, if what is sacred is the same as
what is dear to God, and is loved because it is sacred, then that
who is dear to God would love as dear to God. but if
what is dear to God is dear to him, because he loves him, then that
which is sacred would be sacred because it loved him. But now you see
that the reverse is true, and that they are quite different from them
each other. Because one (theophilos) is something you have to love
he is worshiped and the other (osion) is loved because he is such a thing
to be loved. So it seems to me, Euthyphro, when I ask you what it is
the essence of holiness, to offer only one characteristic, and not the other
essence - the characteristic of the love of all gods. But still
they refuse to explain to me the nature of holiness. And therefore, if you
please, I will ask you not to hide your treasure, but to tell me once
more so what holiness or piety is, whether it is dear to the gods or not
(because this is an issue we will not disagree on). and what is it
impiety?


EUTHYPHRO: I really don&#39;t know, Socrates, how to express what I mean.
For one reason or another our arguments, in whatever reason we rest them,
he seems to be turning away from us


SOCRATES: Your words, Euthyphro, are like my ancestor&#39;s crafts
Daedalus; and if I were their exponent or speaker, you could tell
that my arguments are removed and will not remain stable where they are
is placed because I am his descendant. But now, from these concepts
they are yours, you must find some other joy, because surely, like you
allow, show a tendency to be on the move.


EUTHYPHRO: No, Socrates, I will also say that you are Daedalus
who sets the arguments in motion? not me, for sure, but you do it
to move or turn, because they would never have stirred as much as I do
interested.


SOCRATES: Then I must be older than Daedalus: because while only
made his own inventions to move, I move those of other people.
And the beauty of it is that I wouldn&#39;t prefer it. Because I would give it
Daedalus&#39; wisdom, and Tandal&#39;s wealth, to be able to hold
and keep them steady. But enough of that. As I realize you are
lazy, I will try to show you how you can teach me
the nature of piety; and I hope you will not swallow your work
So tell me - Isn&#39;t that what is pious necessarily right?


EUTHYPHRO: Yes.


SOCRATES: And so all this is just pious? or, it is what it is
pious all righteous, but what is righteousness, only in part and not all, pious?


EUTHYPHRO: Socrates, I don&#39;t understand you.


SOCRATES: And yet I know that you are as wise as I am
they are younger. But, as I said, dear friend, the abundance of yours
wisdom makes you lazy. Please exercise yourself, because it does not exist
real difficulty to understand me. What do I mean I can explain by one
depicting what I don&#39;t mean. The poet (Stasinus) sings--


&quot;From Zeus, the author and creator of all these things, you will not say:
because there is fear there is also respect. &quot;


Now I disagree with this poet. What respect will I give you?


EUTHYPHRO: Anyway.


SOCRATES: I must not say that there is fear
reverence; because I&#39;m sure many people are afraid of poverty and disease, and
similar evils, but I do not realize that they respect his belongings
their fear.


EUTHYPHRO: Very true.


SOCRATES: But where there is respect, there is fear. for the one who has
a sense of respect and shame for taking any action, fears
and fears a bad reputation.


EUTHYPHRO: Without a doubt.


SOCRATES: Then we are wrong to say that there is fear there
it is also respect. and we must say, where there is respect
also fear. But there is not always respect where there is fear. For
Fear is a broader concept, and respect is part of fear, just like that
Strange is a part of number, and number is a broader concept than
the weird. I guess you&#39;re following me now?


EUTHYPHRO: Very well.


SOCRATES: That was the kind of question I wanted to ask when
I asked if the righteous are always the pious, or the pious are always the righteous
just; and if there may be no justice where there is no piety. For
justice is the most extensive concept of which piety is only one part. I am doing
do you disagree


EUTHYPHRO: No, I think you&#39;re right.


SOCRATES: Then, if piety is part of justice, I guess it should
ask which place? If you have continued research in previous cases.
for example, if you asked me what a Libra number is and where it is
of the number the yoke is, I should not have difficulty answering,
a number representing a shape that has two equal sides. No
agree?


EUTHYPHRO: Yes, I totally agree.


SOCRATES: In a similar way, I want you to tell me which part of justice
It is piety or holiness that I may tell the Study not to make me
injustice, or be accused of impunity, as I now sufficiently teach
from you in the nature of piety or holiness and vice versa.


EUTHYPHRO: Worship or holiness, Socrates, seems to me to be this place
justice offered to the gods, as there is the other part of justice
addressed to men.


SOCRATES: That&#39;s good, Euthyphro. but there is still a small point
for which I would like to have more information, What is it
concept of &quot;attention&quot;? For attention it can hardly be used in the same
meaning when applied to the gods as when applied to other things. For
For example, horses are said to require attention and not every person
able to watch them, but only a person specializing in horseback riding. Is
not so much?


EUTHYPHRO: Definitely.


SOCRATES: I have to assume that the art of horse racing is his art
do i watch horses


EUTHYPHRO: Yes.


SOCRATES: Not even suitable for caring for dogs, but only
hunter?


EUTHYPHRO: True.


SOCRATES: And I must also realize that the art of the hunter is the
art of caring for dogs?


EUTHYPHRO: Yes.


SOCRATES: Since the art of oxherd is the art of paying attention to oxen?


EUTHYPHRO: Very true.


SOCRATES: In the same way, holiness or piety is the art of caring.
the gods; - That will be your meaning, Euthyphro?


EUTHYPHRO: Yes.


SOCRATES: And attention is not always designed for good or benefit
from what is being paid attention to? As in the case of horses,
you may notice that when monitored by the rider&#39;s art
benefited and improved, right?


EUTHYPHRO: True.


SOCRATES: As dogs benefit from the art of hunting and oxen
from the art of oxherd, and all other things tend or are monitored
for their own good and not for their pain?


EUTHYPHRO: Definitely not for their bad.


SOCRATES: But for their own good?


EUTHYPHRO: Of course.


SOCRATES: And he does piety or holiness, which is defined as the
art to look after the gods, to benefit them or to improve them? Would you say?
that when you do a sacred act you make one of the gods better?


EUTHYPHRO: No, no? it certainly wasn&#39;t what I meant.


SOCRATES: And I, Euthyphro, never assume you did. I asked you
question about the nature of attention, because I thought you
not.


EUTHYPHRO: You are doing me justice, Socrates. this is not his kind
attention I mean.


SOCRATES: Good: but I still have to ask what this attention is to the gods
called piety?


EUTHYPHRO: That&#39;s right, Socrates, as the servants show their teachers.


SOCRATES: I understand - a kind of administration to the gods.


EUTHYPHRO: Exactly.


SOCRATES: Medicine is also a kind of service or service, having
see the achievement of an object - wouldn&#39;t you say health?


EUTHYPHRO: You have to.


SOCRATES: Again, there is an art that serves the shipbuilder
in order to achieve a result?


EUTHYPHRO: Yes, Socrates, for the purpose of building a ship.


SOCRATES: Since there is an art that serves the builder with one
view of a house building?


EUTHYPHRO: Yes.


SOCRATES: And tell me, my friend, about the art he serves
to the gods: what job does it help to achieve? Because you definitely have to
you know if, as you say, you are one of all the men who live who is the best
taught in religion.


EUTHYPHRO: And I&#39;m telling the truth, Socrates.


SOCRATES: So tell me, tell me - what is this fair job that
do the gods do with the help of our services?


EUTHYPHRO: Many and righteous, Socrates, are the works they do.


SOCRATES: Because, my friend, and so he is a general. But the leader
they are easily told. You would not say that victory in war is
their leader?


EUTHYPHRO: Definitely.


SOCRATES: The works of the kennel are also very fair, if I
am i wrong but his main job is to produce food from it
Earth?


EUTHYPHRO: Exactly.


SOCRATES: And from the many and just things that the gods did, that is
leader or master?


EUTHYPHRO: I&#39;ve already told you, Socrates, that you need to know all this
things will definitely be very tiring. Let me just say that piety or
holiness teaches how to please the gods with words and deeds, with prayers
and sacrifices. This piety is the salvation of families and states,
such as the careless, which is unpleasant to the gods, is their destruction and
destruction.


SOCRATES: I think you could have answered with much fewer words
main question I asked, Euthyphro, if you had chosen. But I see
clearly that you are not willing to teach me - clearly not: otherwise why,
when we got to the point, did you go back? You only answered
I should have really learned about your nature at the moment
piety. Now, as the questioner of a question necessarily depends on it
respondent, where it leads I must follow. and he can only ask again, what
is he pious and what is piety? You mean, like, saltines and their ilk, eh?
a science of prayer and sacrifice?


EUTHYPHRO: Yes, I do.


SOCRATES: And the sacrifice he gives to the gods and the prayer he asks
the gods?


EUTHYPHRO: Yes, Socrates.


SOCRATES: In this sense, then, is piety a science of demand and donation?


EUTHYPHRO: You understand me primarily, Socrates.


SOCRATES: Yes, my friend. the reason is that I am your electorate
science, and give my mind to it, and therefore nothing you say
they will throw me on me. Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....
of this service to the gods? You mean, like, saltines and their ilk, eh?
to give them?


EUTHYPHRO: Yes, I do.


SOCRATES: Isn&#39;t it the right way to ask them what we want?


EUTHYPHRO: Definitely.


SOCRATES: And the right way to give is to give them in return what
they want from us. There will be no meaning in an art that gives to anyone
what he doesn&#39;t want.


EUTHYPHRO: Very true, Socrates.


SOCRATES: Then piety, Euthyphro, is an art that gods and humans have
do you work with each other?


EUTHYPHRO: This is an expression you can use if you want.


SOCRATES: But I have no particular preference for anything but the truth. I
I hope, however, that you tell me what benefit it gives to the gods
from our gifts. There is no doubt about what they give us. for there
not a good thing they don&#39;t give. but how can we give any good
In return, the thing for them is far from clear. If they give
everything and we give nothing, which should be a business affair
that we have a lot of advantage over them.


EUTHYPHRO: And imagine, Socrates, that any benefit comes from
gods from our gifts?


SOCRATES: But if not, Euthyphro, what is the meaning of the gifts that are
is it given by us to the gods?


EUTHYPHRO: What else, but tributes? and, as I was just now
saying, what pleases them?


SOCRATES: So piety is pleasing to the gods, but not beneficial or
their beloved?


EUTHYPHRO: I have to say that nothing could be more lovable.


SOCRATES: Again, the claim that piety is valuable is repeated
the gods?


EUTHYPHRO: Definitely.


SOCRATES: And when you say that, you may wonder if your words are not
do you stand still, but move away? You will accuse me of being
Daedalus, who makes them leave, does not realize that there is anything else
and a much bigger artist than Daedalus making them turn into one
circle, and it&#39;s yourself. for the argument, as you will understand,
comes to the same point. We did not say that the sanctuary or
Wasn&#39;t piety the same as what the gods love? You have got
forgotten?


EUTHYPHRO: I remember a lot.


SOCRATES: And you do not say that what is worshiped by the gods is sacred.
and it&#39;s not the same as what they like - you see?


EUTHYPHRO: True.


SOCRATES: Then we either made a mistake in our previous claim. or, if we
it was then, we&#39;re wrong now.


EUTHYPHRO: One of the two must be true.


SOCRATES: Then we have to start again and ask, What is piety? this is one
research that I will not tire of continuing as long as lies remain.
and please don&#39;t make fun of me, but do your best,
and tell me the truth. Because, if anyone knows, it&#39;s you. therefore
I have to keep you, like Proteas, until you say so. If you didn&#39;t have it
Certainly the nature of piety and impunity is known, I am sure
you will never, on behalf of a slave, charge your elderly father
murder. You will not risk making a mistake in front of you
of the gods, and you will have a lot of respect for opinions
of men. I am sure, therefore, that you know the nature of piety and
impiety. So talk, my dear Euthyphro, and don&#39;t hide it
the knowledge.


EUTHYPHRO: Another time, Socrates? because I&#39;m in a hurry and I have to leave now.


SOCRATES: Unfortunately! my partner, and will you leave me in despair? I was
hoping that you will teach me the nature of piety and dishonesty.
and then I could clear up the Study and its indictment. I
would tell him that I had been enlightened by Euthyphro and I had
I left the exhaustive innovations and conjectures, in which I have only remained
through ignorance and now I am going to live a better life.
